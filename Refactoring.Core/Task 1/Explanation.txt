Task:
1- Look at the classes in folder BEFORE, understand what it does, and refactor it (if it needs to be) in a way you think is right.
2- If you make changes, be ready to explain why you made them; also, identify problem parts in existing code, if any. 
3- If you make any changes, clone existing classes into the AFTER folder and make your changes there.
